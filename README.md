## Project Overview

This project provides an in-depth analysis of hospital admissions, patient demographics, and healthcare trends. The objective is to gain insights into patient profiles, admission patterns, and outcomes to support strategic decision-making in hospital management. By exploring demographics, admission sources, diagnoses, and insurance coverage, we aim to identify factors influencing hospital length of stay and patient admissions.

## Objective(s)

The key objectives of this analysis are:
- To understand the demographics of admitted patients, particularly focusing on age, ethnicity, and admission patterns.
- To analyze hospital admissions by various attributes, including time, source, and type of admission.
- To explore relationships between patient demographics, diagnosis types, and hospital length of stay.

## Dataset(s)

The **Hospital Admissions** dataset is a comprehensive hospital admissions dataset related to admission information, patients demographics and outcomes:

- **Source**: Public dataset provided by Tableau.
- **Size**: 5,700 total admissions across different admittime and discharge time.
- **Features**: Age, ethnicity, insurance, admittime, dischtime, diagnosis, ED, admission type, discharge location...

The dataset was pre-cleaned and prepared in SQL, with minor data processing done in tableau for further analysis.

## Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning**: Ensured that the dataset was free from null values and duplicated entries.
2. **Descriptive Analysis**: Generated summary statistics to provide an overview of admissions, demographics, and diagnostic trends.
3. **Emergency Department Metrics**: Assessed admissions originating from the ED and their impact on overall length of stay.
4. **Visualization**: Created Tableau dashboards to highlight trends over the years.

## Results & Insights

Key insights derived from the analysis:
- **Demographic Insights**: Analysis revealed the largest proportion of admissions was among white patients, with a higher number of male patients compared to female patients.
- **Trends**: Majority of the patients **(43%)** were covered by private insurance, influencing the revenue structure.

## Conclusion & Next Steps

This analysis highlights key trends in hospital admissions, demographics, and length of stay, revealing significant differences across age groups, ethnicity, and admission types. These insights can help inform resource allocation, improve patient care strategies, and support efficient discharge planning. Additionally, understanding insurance distribution and ED-related patterns provides valuable input for hospital administration and policy improvement.
